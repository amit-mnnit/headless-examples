# Getting Started with AEM Headless Adaptive Form App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a sample next.js app which will help to create JSON based forms using Adaptive Form libraries. This application is built to consume the form model definition of an AEM Adaptive Form.

## System Requirements

* Latest release of GIT

* Node.js 16.13.0 or later

* React 16.14.0 or later

## Libraries required
[af-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aemforms/af-core) - To manage the state and create form model using json.

[af-react-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aemforms/af-react-renderer) - To communicate between model and view layer

[af-react-vanilla-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aemforms/af-react-vanilla-components) - View layer components that is optional you can create your own components.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

Run the development server and ppen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Mappings Object

A Mappings Object is a JavaScript map that maps the field types defined in the Specification to its respective React Component. The Adaptive Form Super Component uses this map to render the different components defined in the Form JSON.

To use that in your project use the following import, assuming you have added the project as a dependency in your project

```
import {mappings} from '@aemforms/af-react-vanilla-components'
```

Once you have fetched the JSON for the form or you can create json locally, the code would look like

```
import {mappings} from '@aemforms/af-react-vanilla-components'
const json = {...}
<AdaptiveForm mappings={mappings} formJson={json} />
```
